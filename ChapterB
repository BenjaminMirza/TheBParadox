## The Beginning ##

In The Beginning there was only darkness. Only God Existed. Nah. Not even God Existed at first. It was just nothingness. Like Death itself.
And then something came. Something with light. It was dim. Not so bright. Yet it held so much power and light, inside.
Nowadays we say ANti-matter to Darkness. Like nothing exists in Anti matter. The negative of the matter.

Anyhow ....

N The beginning not even Death Existed. Nothing. And Until this date no one can understand the Darkness.
